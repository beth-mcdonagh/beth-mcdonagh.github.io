Hello and welcome to my website! 

I've been a postdoctoral researcher in the ROFS (Regional Ocean Forecasting System) division of CMCC since 2024, after completing the PhD programme “Future Earth, Climate Change and Societal Challenge” at the University of Bologna with supervision from CMCC. During my PhD, I studied the effects of barotropic and internal tides on the Mediterranean Sea circulation through numerical experiments. Currently, my project uses a nested modelling approach to integrate kilometre-scale horizontal resolution in the Gibraltar Strait within a forecasting model of the Mediterranean Sea. 


Research interests
======
My research interests include tides and internal waves, their interactions with other phenomena, high-resolution modelling of the ocean, the general circulation of the Mediterranean Sea, and the Gibraltar Strait dynamics.
